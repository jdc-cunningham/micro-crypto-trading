Last doing
- do another buy and see that it's written out
- pull the order by stored id to check status
- have the buy go through then sell it to log that response
- check that the chart pulls down the value based on USD or crypto held
- rest of tasks

Member that song "it's my day, my day"

Yeah got a full day, fresh brain, all for me.

Will wrap this up and go back to my robot project

Ahh man DNT dipped to 0.084 overnight

Ugh I'm stuck on this

I think I just got it/was looking in the wrong place

I'm making a buy order fail on purpose and ran into that

Alright this is looking good, I gotta do the order check

It's so hard to buy (price jumps beyond or below), anyway I have a status now

So I'll do a sell and get that info/check the math of the portfolio balance

Then I'll write the main looper

Figure out some basic algo to use and plug it in

Check the front end pulls stuff correctly

Then should be good to start trading on its own
