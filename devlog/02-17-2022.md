I'm pretty much done with this project now, I need to have it run well so I can have it work in the background unsupervised for a solid week but yeah.

Issue now is the math is wrong on money so it's thinking it has more money than it has/insufficient funds.

I think the fees aren't factored in so I updated that... it's a down market today so action will be slow

Oh man... today's a bad day... all those gains gone

Lol I got baited again, false hope

iTs GoInG uP gUys

Ahh still bugs good job Jacob, good job

So DNT is f'd

I'm going to have to stop the trades and catch up the balances, see what happened

DNT sold it has $59.12 balance right now

Portfolio values says: the portfolio balance is spot on... no it's not it's 59.51 vs. 59.12 actual

Just going to check the balances/write down logs

DNT
- $59.12
- trying to buy
MDT
- 670 MDT trying to sell at $0.08675 has $0.42 balance
BLZ
- 252 BLZ trying to sell at $0.2462 has $0.31 balance
LOOM
- has 665 LOOM trying to sell at $0.09 has $0.38 balance
XYO
- has 2526 XYO sell at $0.022451 has $0.28 balance
TRU
- has 241 TRU sell at $0.2331 has $0.20 balance
ANKR
- has 670 ANKR sell at $0.08370 has $0.28 balance
AMP
- has 1762 AMP sell at $0.03293 has $0.37 balance
SPELL
- has 9788 SPELL sell at $0.00580 has $0.36 balance

Huge losses across the board, been a crappy day

I think so far what's happening is when it sells, it does not update the balance correctly/thinks it has more money than it actually has.

I will dump the orders for back tracing.

It's looking good though, did a buy then sell
