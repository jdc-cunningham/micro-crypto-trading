I'm pretty much done with this project now, I need to have it run well so I can have it work in the background unsupervised for a solid week but yeah.

Issue now is the math is wrong on money so it's thinking it has more money than it has/insufficient funds.

I think the fees aren't factored in so I updated that... it's a down market today so action will be slow
