So yeah, that problem where the portfolio_values.json file breaks keeps coming back

I thought it might have been an async write issue or maybe a JSON stringify deal but nope

I did have a decent idea to log the writes

Still it breaks and unfortunately it broke overnight about 5-6 hrs of down time

Ugh

A buy went through for BLZ

The post-buy write would have fired, it did not work correctly because the balance is still full

Looks like DNT has an issue too

it's just a type issue

Oof XYO has a problem too, overbuy

The secondary amount check if there's no order type, I upped the comparison to $10 since that shouldn't happen

If there's left over money it's usually around $0.28

Another one of these came through

```
_amount_unit":0.00001,"smallest_price_unit":0.00001,"current_order_type":"buy"}}
```

I'll also turn the writes to synchronous

I'm going to swap IOTX with TRU, I will briefly turn the system off to change values/destroy-create portfolio and fund

Yeah so at this point the development branch is completely f'd, the Pi code is the baseline

night time
This thing is still failing here and there

It looks like that random append issue is gone, maybe the sync write helped

Now there's a problem after selling the buy stuff is not updated right/keeps trying to buy

Made an update will see if it helps

Good news is I'm up... BLZ is almost up by $5, all except 1 coin is above or at $55 so that's good

I'm going to move the tx status writing to the post event of the orders vs. doing one before the order and after

Man this is super f'd now the state got complicated

Sometimes amount key in portfolio_values disappears

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I'm going to rework this code

It's bothering me the thought that it won't trade overnight

So what do I have to do?

- I have to turn off the current orders buy or sell (sucks it's a lot of CBP UI navigation)
- match the portfolio data
- rework the scheduled job script
  - does it have an order?
    - no
      - same as below but check appropriate branch based on balance/amount of coin
    - yes
      - buy
        - check status
          - done
            - update portfolio
            - perform opposite order
      - sell
        - check status
          - done
            - update portfolio
            - perform opposite order

Alright made the changes let's see how it does

I'm gonna laugh if it's still bad

Wa wa... nothing

Typo/no linter

I don't know why, that's something I should use from the start of any project, so easy to just run `$npm run lint` and boom no problems

Aqua Unit Patro Squad

Third time's the charm camel case vs. snake

What's the next error, not seeing  the orders pop up

Missing variables from the code regoatitagain

My desk squeaks as I type it's annoying the hell out of me

Same issues something missing

It's hard to work on this since it's not mocked and the scheduler is every 5 minutes

Also I'm blind/half-ass developing

Okay it's looking good, I cleared out some console logs as they were flooding the CRON log file

Still 2 out 9 are below 55 so that's not terrible

Up $9.33 and down $3.59

Ahh that looks nice
