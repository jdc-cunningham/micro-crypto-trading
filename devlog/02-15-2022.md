So yeah, that problem where the portfolio_values.json file breaks keeps coming back

I thought it might have been an async write issue or maybe a JSON stringify deal but nope

I did have a decent idea to log the writes

Still it breaks and unfortunately it broke overnight about 5-6 hrs of down time

Ugh

A buy went through for BLZ

The post-buy write would have fired, it did not work correctly because the balance is still full

Looks like DNT has an issue too

it's just a type issue

Oof XYO has a problem too, overbuy

The secondary amount check if there's no order type, I upped the comparison to $10 since that shouldn't happen

If there's left over money it's usually around $0.28

Another one of these came through

```
_amount_unit":0.00001,"smallest_price_unit":0.00001,"current_order_type":"buy"}}
```

I'll also turn the writes to synchronous

I'm going to swap IOTX with TRU, I will briefly turn the system off to change values/destroy-create portfolio and fund

Yeah so at this point the development branch is completely f'd, the Pi code is the baseline
