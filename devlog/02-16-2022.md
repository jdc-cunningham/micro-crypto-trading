surprise, it failed again

I see the issue, the order response was just the status not the full object

I have to cancel some orders/sink the prices again and then it should work

Ugh so stupid... "everything looks good" 8 hours ago and it's not processing good job Jacob good job

So it bought (BLZ) but did not sell

AMP bought but not selling

The balances were not updated or amount bought/tx info

OMG WTF REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

The positive thing is these things are gaining, obviously in a positive market and an "algo" that only sells when it has risen 2%

So it sold but did not buy back in... why?

BECAUSE IT'S A POS that's why

There are no errors that's nice

I have to go through and check all the portfolio values again... ugh

It's just slow as shit to do on CBP interface

This lag in devleopment is so bad man... like I've already spaced out 5 minutes later and I have to come back and figure out what I was doing again.

We're on the cusp though, the brink, the precipice, I'll also have plotted the mesh soon on my other project

Was initially trying to interface with this IMU to get the angle but it was not working at all... burned idk like a week of messing around with that on/off... sweep works fine though which is odd (gyro about z axis), these things are pieces of shit though so idk... as in you buy 4 and 2 of them work. They're $15 each too. I'm slowly learning to avoid buying garbage. Though the next step up is $30 each so that's a chunk of change.

I gotta workd hard next 3 days catch up

OMFG it's nested eg. status.status ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Lol DMT-USD JR has entered the chat

This might be the last problem... if it runs for an entire day buy sell buy sell... then I can start counting from there although I'm already up some

MF... it's still not working

omg it's the nested status.price... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

AALLLLLLLL THE BUGS I WROTE BY NOW.... IF I ONLY KNEW BACK THEN....

No getting over...
