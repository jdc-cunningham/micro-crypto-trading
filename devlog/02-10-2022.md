Well... I'm super tired today and I can't really do anything difficult.

So I'll work on this/screw around.

Look at that, we're already up $0.68 hell yeah I can quit my job soon

Let's see if we seel while we're up... damn... 

You lose $0.28 for fees but looks like you gain 54.96 - 54.46 -> 50 cents

I do want to do some error handling like it fails to buy, too expensive, need a notification system

I am jumping the gun on this project

I just don't want to spend much time on it is the thing

There is something else too like at what point is it good to sell

Holy crap earlier today it dropped by a cent so I would have lost like 2.4 dollars huh

Anyway let me sell this just to cross that functionality off the list

The "is it worth selling" will be implemented somewhere else

So if I can potentially do 333 calls a day... 12 price calls per hour, that leaves me some extra

So the job would run every 5 minutes

Song's on my [miiiiiinnnnddd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3M-XFxF1UQ)

Crap can't use interpolation/literal in accessing process.env

Well I missed my selling window but let's see

wtf it's still undefined

This doesn't want to work for some reason

```
const getPortfolioCredentials = (portfolioNumber) => {
  const idStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_ID'`;
  const keyStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_KEY'`;
  const passphraseStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_PASSPHRASE'`;
  const secretStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_SECRET'`;

  return {
    id: process.env[idStr],
    key: process.env[keyStr],
    passphrase: process.env[passphraseStr],
    secret: process.env[secretStr],
  }
}

```

Seems like it [should](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66626413/2710227)

So... let's do it the dumb way and manually write those out

Oh no it's dipping come back!

Nice I have it waiting to be sold... curious what the fee is, is it 0.5%?

Anyway I can jump to other things while I wait for that

One thing that's "hard" is the JSON-file-based db which yeah it's stupid but this is not performant.

I just don't want to deal with setting up some DB/specifying the schemas

I also have to remove TRU from here and use all slots, I've done the initial testing required

It's almost sold I'm waiting

One thing I need to do... noo lol it went the other way was about to break $0.229

I need to pull historical data just to have a replicated graph locally and then I will visually figure out what I want to get (those peaks/troughs) and confirm against the chart once I have a function or two written.

Then I'm not going to use historical data or something "back testing?" but rather I'll just start tracking the price per my logs... because I'm not hooking into a websocket/dealing with real time stuff... I don't have a lot of money to use for the small rises.

On RH I had a share of VOO and that made some money, that's like a stable long term investing to me... this is just screwing around with an automated system/shooting yourself in the foot.

I have two stocks left in my RH and they're both down about $8 total which isn't really anything. I'm just trying to avoid selling at a loss with my main coin to free up the money for this project.

I already have had to sell and man I ate it... like almost 50% loss sucks.

Of course it takes like a week to move that money from RH back into cash so I can't really use it anyway. Right now my income is not a weekly/bi-weekly basis so I literally have no incoming cash flow.

My other CBP project keeps track of my loses and yeah it's nearing $2K lol, rename the app "pain tracker"

Oh okay this one's loss is not too bad... man what sucks is tax time... through H&R block I have to enter every single one of these entries by hand... sucks, mostly because H&R block catches this work in one state, live in another state, avoid double taxation deal better than other providers.

At least I won't have that problem next year.

hmm looks like this sell is not being reflected in the FIFO calculation, the loss is about 20% though from initial purchase price

lol yeah so I lost like $12 on that sell

Funny though:

This is another variation of that CBP cost basis thing I made and yeah... it tells me what I know, I got rekt.

These are all tiny amounts but yeah "buy the dip" as they say but it keeps dipping

> sold 0.0## at: $66100 on 2021-11-15

That was nice, that was before it reversed and hard

Lol he doesn't learn

How do you make money? Build things people will pay for.

Lucky for me, I am pretty employable and the field I'm in (tech) has a lot of opportunity.

I also cover my own ass/have back up plans like this Upgrade plan thing for example, it's a loan but in a credit card form/you don't owe anything until you use it.

That's a worst-case scenario thing, I would try to avoid using. It's not like a credit card where you can just pay a small amount against a large balance and it stays the same. This will grow to match whatever you owe proportionally.

I would sell all of my shit before I used this thing but yeah, credit/loans are cool if you know how to use them, I learned that the hard way.

WTF... the sell didn't go through or I put in the wrong amount... after the chrome extension injection goes through (pulling Reddit content into CBP's interface) it does break part of the site lol the "Select Market" drop down in particular.

Awe wtf... my sell was a decimal off lol

There we go... there's my triple-digit loss that looks right lol

Okay... I want to get historical data and do that math stuff, that's like the hardest thing. Rest is just wiring shit same old CRUD glue

Oh crap I can't get historical data huh (my plan isn't part of it)

Well I can use fake numbers and then work from that

Alright I'm going to work on the web app real quick

I'm using this react-chartjs-2 component

Ehh basic demo has a problem I'll just use it straight up, I know it works

Mmmmmmmmmmmmm I don't need React for this.

KILL IT!

Ugh... I can't turn it off, anxiety, something is wrong, what is wrong? All my bills are paid for the month. I have more than a year of burn rate.

Just enjoy the day, I get these moments where I can't have fun... I can't watch TV, I'm just like alive but you know, not actively doing something idk. Those are when I'm super tired. I'm tired today but not that bad I got some sleep.

This project has a month-long "study" so I need to get it done to some state where it is automatically trading.

I was a front-ender for over a year as in PSD to HTML and I hated it. I can make almost anything at this point, I just find no pleasure in making some pretty scrolling effect or a cool-looking button.

So I got out of that job and landed a software engineering job thankfully as in agile/scrum, tech design planning, implementing, unit test/regression testing, pipelines, etc...

TRU is starting to turn around but still not sold.

Let me do that math/fake analysis thing real quick.

I'll populate this chart with some data that looks like a cryptocurrency plot for a day and then get those max/min values.

It does suck that I don't have history to work with... but I can gauge the frequency visually and put that in... for an estimate on daily action in a given day.

I don't know I was going to do some like word counting on subreddits it's not hard, because you can take any url and turn it into text with their JSON thing.

Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/sozb08/daily_discussion_february_10_2022/.json)

And then you just parse it and look for stuff. Of course they have an API and what not.

Oh I could also use min-max price range history too.

This is probably going to be a guarantee of wasted money, I'm not like a math guy or I see patterns or anything.

It's just fun for me to make systems that work, you build all the little parts and connect them and it runs

Alright switching to energy drinks and from Future Funk chill music that I know to metal that I know to get pumped

The known music bit helps to not get distracted, if I really want to focus I'll loop some songs over and over

I need to build the history every time those 5 min price calls run.

If the JSON stuff becomes a problem I'll migrate it. But let's see, there will be under 9000 points of data at least.

I think reading/parsing that is not an issue.

The Pi has a lot of power too since it's quad core and it runs every 5 minutes so it's not realy constrained by time

IN WAAAAAAVEEESSSSSS first song in this set of music

I like this kind of freestyle development where I don't have to think, no testing or anything, just manifest it from nothing, it's not production, it's just for me
