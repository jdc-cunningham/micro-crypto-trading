Well... I'm super tired today and I can't really do anything difficult.

So I'll work on this/screw around.

Look at that, we're already up $0.68 hell yeah I can quit my job soon

Let's see if we seel while we're up... damn... 

You lose $0.28 for fees but looks like you gain 54.96 - 54.46 -> 50 cents

I do want to do some error handling like it fails to buy, too expensive, need a notification system

I am jumping the gun on this project

I just don't want to spend much time on it is the thing

There is something else too like at what point is it good to sell

Holy crap earlier today it dropped by a cent so I would have lost like 2.4 dollars huh

Anyway let me sell this just to cross that functionality off the list

The "is it worth selling" will be implemented somewhere else

So if I can potentially do 333 calls a day... 12 price calls per hour, that leaves me some extra

So the job would run every 5 minutes

Song's on my [miiiiiinnnnddd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3M-XFxF1UQ)

Crap can't use interpolation/literal in accessing process.env

Well I missed my selling window but let's see

wtf it's still undefined

This doesn't want to work for some reason

```
const getPortfolioCredentials = (portfolioNumber) => {
  const idStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_ID'`;
  const keyStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_KEY'`;
  const passphraseStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_PASSPHRASE'`;
  const secretStr = `'CBP_PORTFOLIO_${portfolioNumber}_SECRET'`;

  return {
    id: process.env[idStr],
    key: process.env[keyStr],
    passphrase: process.env[passphraseStr],
    secret: process.env[secretStr],
  }
}

```

Seems like it [should](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66626413/2710227)

So... let's do it the dumb way and manually write those out

Oh no it's dipping come back!

Nice I have it waiting to be sold... curious what the fee is, is it 0.5%?

Anyway I can jump to other things while I wait for that

One thing that's "hard" is the JSON-file-based db which yeah it's stupid but this is not performant.

I just don't want to deal with setting up some DB/specifying the schemas

I also have to remove TRU from here and use all slots, I've done the initial testing required
