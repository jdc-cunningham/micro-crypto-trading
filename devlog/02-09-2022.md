Oh yeah I did have a thought about using a differnet coin, not one of the 9 I picked for the testing ground.

To make sure everything's working before I commit to all of them running at once.

There is a safety net where the portfolios will be limited to what money is in them.

I'll have to look at that list from yesterday and find one to work with.

Yeah I'll go with TRU it has good indicators from my dunce scale.

This project actually shouldn't take that long to develop... there are some things that would be more tedious like if I wanted to add Twitter parsing or something.

Well I'm mentally spent, can't work on math stuff so I'll just do work on here.

I need to establish the API calls and get a price.

Then I'll do some initial "math" regarding looking at a chart.

By "too spent for math" I mean learning something knew.

I've interfaced with the coinbase pro API in the past so I'm re-using some stuff from there, namely the authentication for requests

Otherwise I am looking at their [API docs](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/reference/exchangerestapi_getcurrency) to figure it out.

The way I double wrap a promise with a async/await is suspect... but every time I try to use async/await on its own, it never actually waits.

This is odd, don't see a price

Hmm I might need another price source... I don't want a websocket, I'm not dealing with that kind of precision.
