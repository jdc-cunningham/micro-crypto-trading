I'm pretty much done spending time on this at this point.

But the IOTX has still not bought so I'm doing a manual override there

An example price range is 0.11273 - .11144 = .00129

My "buySubtractionMultiplier" is 25 * 0.00001 which is 0.00025

Idk that seems good

So if I was to manually buy this, I'm looking at the minute chart and I see the numbers above 0.11273 and

0.11144 as recent peaks

It's actually on its way back down maybe to 0.11129

which current price is 0.11288 -> 0.00159 apart

Going to check if the decimal counting is right

It is counting them right

```
DNT count 4
DNT sell order in progress
MDT count 5
MDT sell order in progress
BLZ count 4
BLZ sell order in progress
LOOM count 4
LOOM sell order in progress
XYO count 6
XYO sell order in progress
IOTX count 5
IOTX buy order in progress
ANKR count 5
ANKR sell order in progress
AMP count 5
AMP sell order in progress
SPELL count 5
SPELL sell order in progress

```

Even XYO is able to work, I think it's the right decimal place/volume activity for IOTX is the problem

BLZ finally sold but it did not buy back in

I'm going to turn it off again and update the logic to trade

Oh yeah I think I just did a dunce move where I was editing an object in memory but not writing it out to the file so those changes were lost...

So right now only two are above original price rest are down or stuck at 55 from not being able to buy (only IOTX)

I reworked the trading code so it is based on the actual order status
