### Micro Crypto Trading
Disclaimer: I am not an expert, this is just a fun hobby thing for this > blog post < (update)

### Stack
- web app
  - ReactJS and ChartJS
- API
  - NodeJS and ExpressJS, ran with pm2

### Data/Trading/Algo
- CoinmarketCap for price info (using free api key)
- Coinbase Pro for actual trades
- no algo other than just basic price diff check against thresholds

### How far does this repo go
The portfolio generation in CBP is manual. You have a cap of 10, I just messed around with 9. I targetted the cheapest coins with the best "indication" of action.

See the development branch for my thoughts as I made this thing over time

### Did this make money?
ANSWER - I ran this for a month
